<div class="rfigure" style="max-width: 16em">

Race selection
</div>
<p>
Each player can choose one of three races:
</p><dl>
<dt>Nander</dt>
<dd>Their short stature and often childlike appearance belie their skill at crafting.</dd>
<dt>Poli</dt>
<dd>Wobbly people who swing their round bottoms between their hands.</dd>
<dt>Volci</dt>
<dd>Are we not men? We are wolf men.</dd>
</dl><p>
After both players have chosen a race, player 1 presses Start to start the game.
</p>

<h2 id="phases">Phases</h2>
<p>
The game is played in rounds, each with three phases. Each phase has a time limit, and while the timer is counting, either player can press the Start button to pause the game.
</p>

<h3 id="phasefurni">Phase 1: Furnish</h3>
<p>
You earn rent money for areas inside the house that can be accessed through doors from outside.  Use this money to buy furniture to improve your house.
</p><dl>
<dt>To place furniture</dt>
<dd>Move the cursor to an item in your inventory and press A. Then move where you want the furniture and press A to put each piece down. You can rotate rugs with the B button. To return to Stock, press and hold B.</dd>
<dt>To move furniture</dt>
<dd>Press Up until the cursor moves past the top of the list. Then move the hand truck to a piece of furniture and pick it up with A, or press B to return to Stock.</dd>
<dt>To buy furniture</dt>
<dd>Press Right to move to the Shop pane. Press Up or Down to see each item and its price, and then press A to buy something. To return to Stock, press Left or B.</dd>
<dt>To sell furniture</dt>
<dd>If you've stolen furniture and you know you'll never have anywhere to put it, you can recover 1/4 of its selling price. Move the cursor to an item in your inventory and hold B and press A.</dd>
</dl><p>
At the end of each round, the game rates your house.
You get points for each piece of furniture in your house.
Some items (bookcase, ficus, flowers) give bonus points if placed near walls.
If you have all items in a particular set next to each other, you earn more points:
</p><dl class="compact">
<dt>Living room</dt>
<dd>sofa, bookcase</dd>
<dt>Dining room</dt>
<dd>table, chair</dd>
<dt>Kitchen</dt>
<dd>fridge, oven, trashcan</dd>
<dt>Bathroom</dt>
<dd>sink, bathtub, toilet</dd>
</dl><p>
The player with the higher rating wins the round. The first to win 5 rounds wins the game.
</p><p>
Some furniture has a use other than to look pretty.
A bat lets your units beat up those of your opponent.
Missile silos let you blow up portions of your opponent's walls.
And don't forget a bed for each person in your house to sleep in, as more beds (up to three) means more units.
</p>

<h3 id="phasevandal">Phase 2: Battle</h3>
<p>
Don't stop at prettying up your own house; go vandalize your opponent's house.
</p><p>
You control up to three units, one for each bed.
To move a unit, use the Control Pad to set a target point on the field.
While the unit is moving toward the target point, you can switch to the next unit (Select or B+A) and give commands to another unit.
</p><p>
To use your silos, face one and press A.
Then move the cursor and press A to fire a missile.
The more silos you buy, the more missiles you can shoot before the silo reloads.
Press B to go back to moving.
</p><p>
Once you've blown a hole in your opponent's wall, you can move your units into the opponent's house and steal furniture.
Press B to pick up an item, then carry it across the road to add it to your inventory.
Or press B to pick up a bat, then press A to beat intruders or break down fences.
</p><p>
TIP: Path-finding is very primitive compared to a PC RTS.
Let your unit reach a doorway before moving through it.
</p>

<h3 id="phasebuild">Phase 3: Build</h3>
<div class="rfigure" style="width:168px">
<img src="docs/polyominoes_no_o.png">
The 18 polyominoes of the build phase
</div>
<p>
Use wall pieces to repair damage to the walls of your house and add additional rooms. 
</p><p>
There are 18 pieces with 1 to 5 connected blocks that fit in a 3x3 square and do not contain a 2x2 square of blocks.
The game gives small pieces more often early on and adds the twistier pieces in later rounds.
It shows a preview of the next piece above the current piece to let you plan your construction.
</p><p>
Move each piece into position with the Control Pad. Press B to turn it by 90 degrees, and then press A to place it. As you enclose areas with pieces, they will be marked as claimed.
</p><p>
At the end of the build phase, furniture in areas that you failed to repair returns to your inventory.
The edges of your walls are smoothed by removing walls that touch one or fewer tiles.
Afterward, you can remove excess wall thickness and add doors to the new rooms so that you can earn rent money from them and place furniture inside.
Rooms without doors are drawn darkened to show that light can't get in.
