[1/5] Overview

It is the story of a
neighborhood rivalry that
got w-a-y out of hand.
Trampling each other's
gardens was only the
beginning. Soon they were
shooting off model rockets
to blow holes in the walls of
the house across the street.

Try to make your house look
more attractive than that
of your opponent. The game
is played in three phases:
1. Buy furniture to
   put in your house.
2. Break into your opponent's
   house to steal furniture.
3. Repair and expand your
   house.
Repeat as long as needed.
